"I've developed a Project Management System (PMS) in Java with a graphical user interface
(GUI). This application allows users to sign up, log in, create and manage clinics, add and
remove doctors, patients, and appointments, and manage prescriptions. Additional features
include a pharmacy module for purchases, viewing schedules, and transferring patients between
clinics. It offers a wide range of functionalities to streamline clinic management and improve
efficiency."
